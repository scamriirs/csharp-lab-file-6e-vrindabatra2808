//In a college campus, structured parking system is required to efficiently manage parking fees collection. The parking system must classify vehicles into 3 types:
//1: VIP/ Faculty Car	No parking fees
//2: Student Car	Rs. 10 
//3: Visitorâ€™s Car	Rs. 20
//4: Show Summary	Total revenue, Total number of each vehicle
//5: Exit	Program terminates
//The system should allow users to register a vehicle entry, automatically collect the total collection and generate a summary report displaying the information, the number of vehicle parked.
